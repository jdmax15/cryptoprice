Crypto price program

I will be creating a program that can fetch tthe price of a bitcoin from a selected date and tell you how much it would be worth today.

I will be using CoinGecko API for my API pull requests

https://www.coingecko.com/en/developers/dashboard

TO DO:

1. Make every request write to a .txt or .csv file, with a timestamp.
2. Ability to search previous request history.
3. More parameters to return from the get coin data funciton.
4. Feature to input a date, amount of coins bought on that day to show what they'd be worth today.
